# Service Binding Specification

Specification for binding services to runtime applications running in Kubernetes.  

## Terminology definition

*  **service** - any software that is exposing functionality.  Could be a RESTful application, a database, an event stream, etc.
*  **application** - in this specification we refer to a single microservices as an application.  This is different than an umbrella (SIG) _Application_ which refers to a set of microservices.
*  **binding** - providing the necessary information for an application to connect to a service.
*  **secret** - refers to a Kubernetes [Secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/).
*  **config map** - refers to a Kubernetes [ConfigMap](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/).

## Motivation

*  Need a consistent way to bind k8s application to services (applications, databases, event streams, etc)
*  A standard / spec / RFC will enable adoption from different service providers
*  Cloud Foundry has done this well.Â  The equivalent is not available for k8s.

## Proposal

Main section of the doc.  Has sub-section that outline the design.

### 1.  Making a service bindable

*  What metadata is needed for a service to be bindable (e.g. name of fields it supports, name of secret it produces, etc)
*  Where is this information located

### 2.  Service Binding Schema

*  What is the schema of a Service Binding object / structure.
*  What metadata goes along that describes it

### 3.  Request service binding

*  How do we request a binding from a service (assume the service has been provisioned)

### 4.  Mounting binding information

*  Where in the container do we mount the binding information (e.g. what is the structure of the folders / files)
*  Consideration with clusters, namespaces, or VMs

### Extra:  Consuming binding

*  How are application expected to consume binding information 
*  Each framework may take a different approach, so this is about samples & recommendations (best practices)
*  Validates the design
